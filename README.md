# vSTARS_MSAW_CREATOR
Uses the MyFSim.com MSAW_CREATOR.php script to build a MSAW File for vSTARS without having to copy/paste the Website UI output data.


**USERS:**
This Batch File only works for USA Airports
It takes around 18min to complete an airport depending on your internet connection along with the MyFSim.com server load.


**PROGRAMERS:**
This BATCH was not written to be pretty or efficient; It was a quick response to a need of mine and it works for others aswell.
I will likely not be refactoring it.

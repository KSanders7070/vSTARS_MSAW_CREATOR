# vSTARS_MSAW_CREATOR
Uses the MyFSim.com MSAW_CREATOR.php script to build a MSAW File for vSTARS without having to copy/paste the Website UI output data.


**USERS:**
This Batch File only works for US Airports that can be found on AIRNAV.COM.
It takes around 18min to complete an airport depending on your internet connection along with the MyFSim.com server load. Download the vSTARS_MSAW_CREATOR.bat, Double-Click it and follow the prompts.


**PROGRAMERS:**
This BATCH was not written to be pretty or efficient.
I will likely not be refactoring it.
